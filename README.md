# Rice
All of my dotfiles, wallpapers etc with some tips. (Arch nord themed rice with i3wm)

### Important notes:
 - Download code-features from AUR in case of python extension activation failure.
 - ```
   sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
   ```
   To install plug for nvim
- Don't forget to `chmod +x .config/polybar/launch.sh`

### Favourite oh-my-zsh themes:
(Starred and italicized is the one I currenty use)
 - bureau -> Formalish
 - amuse -> Simple and elegant
 - darkblood -> Hackerish
 - eastwood -> super clean
 - \[\*\] *intheloop -> Clean, techno and cool*

### For me:
Don't forget Orca
