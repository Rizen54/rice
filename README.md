All of my dotfiles, wallpapers etc with some tips. (Arch nord themed rice with i3wm)

### Important notes:
 - Download code-features from AUR in case of python extension activation failure.
 - ```
   sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
   ```
   To install plug for nvim
- Don't forget to `chmod +x .config/polybar/launch.sh`
